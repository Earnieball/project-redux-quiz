# Redux quiz group project

Project made to get familiar with Redux and practice the useDispatch and useSelector hooks.



## The problem

Since Redux was completely new to all of us, we decided to do the project together, mob-programming style. We struggled a bit with getting the right data out from the store.
The styling was made with styled components and if we had some more time we would probably clean up the code a bit and add some kind of points system.
